#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 3
To get started:
Get the "restaurantserver" at https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3.
Follow the instructions there to get it running.

Download the files in this project and start a webserver that serves files from the "dist-folder".
(I have used browserSync as a server using my gulpfile)
